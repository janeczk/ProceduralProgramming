# Procedural Programming Projects

This repository contains my old projects and assignments from the Procedural Programming course. It includes various examples of procedural programming concepts, basic algorithms, and code snippets for practice and learning purposes.

Feel free to explore or use the code as a reference.  
**Note:** These projects reflect my learning progress during the course and may not represent best coding practices.
